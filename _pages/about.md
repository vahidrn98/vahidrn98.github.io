I've graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I'm looking forward to pursuing my studies as a prospective Master's student in Artificial Intelligence (with a keen interest in Reinforcement Learning) while continuing my profession as a software developer. ([my CV](https://vahidrn98.github.io/cv/))
