Sharif AI Challenge is a programming competition for all who are interested in artificial intelligence. This competition is  held in two phases annually. Including an online and an on-site phase in which competitors will compete in teams of three in a game designed by our technical team.
The only pre-requisite to enter this competition is familiarity with programming using C++, Java or python. But obviously, knowledge of algorithmic thinking and artificial intelligence will be a great asset for any of the participating teams. The registration for online competition is free.
