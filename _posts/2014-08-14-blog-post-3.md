The goal of this project is to develop an AI Bot able to learn how to play the popular game Snake from scratch. In order to do it, I implemented a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm. This approach consists in giving the system parameters related to its state, and a positive or negative reward based on its actions. No rules about the game are given, and initially the Bot has no information on what it needs to do. The goal for the system is to figure it out and elaborate a strategy to maximize the score - or the reward. We are going to see how a Deep Q-Learning algorithm learns how to play snake, scoring up to 50 points and showing a solid strategy after only 5 minutes of training.([link](https://github.com/vahidrn98/snake-ga))
